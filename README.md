# MADS-QN-Solver:
Use the MADS-QN algorithm to minimize a nonlinear function subject to constraints.


This code will solve a nonlinear, constrained optimization problem of the form

"minimize f(x) for x in Omega"

where Omega is a subset of R^n such every point x in Omega satisfies the constraints

c(x) < 0 for x in Omega

where c(x) is a linear or nonlinear constraint.
